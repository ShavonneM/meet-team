App Engine Deployment using Python 

Brief Project Overview -  
This project is a basic demonstration of how App Engine can be utilized to deploy python code.  

Scope of Work
The simple website shows an example of how Python is used to display several images along with text to a webpage.  
The website is for teaching and demonstration purposes. The file configurations (adapted from Qwiklabs - App Engine Qwikstart Python) can be used as a base for your own project, to display any text and images youâ€™d prefer.

Code base is in the "master" branch.
